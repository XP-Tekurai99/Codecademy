# Why Build on Decentralized Blockchain Architecture?
In this article, we’ll learn some of the reasons to decentralize.

## Why Decentralize?
So what exactly would be the benefit of building on a decentralized blockchain architecture?

Let’s imagine we are building a platform to buy and sell digital goods.

### Censorship Resistance
If we want absolutely anybody to be able to use our platform to buy and sell digital goods, this goal could be derailed if we build on a centralized architecture.
This could happen in a few ways:

The platforms themselves could decide to block our application, or users from certain countries might not be able to use our application.
The founders and owners of the platform could have accessibility and equal access as priorities right now, but what happens when that changes?
Building on decentralized architecture ensures that nobody can block the usage of our application.

Note: This does not mean the platform will have any regulation of content or that every single piece of data should be stored on-chain.
There are multiple ways to build dapps and not every piece of data should be stored on the blockchain.

How can we have regulation of content while still having immutable, censorship-resistant technology? There are web3 concepts, like NFTs and DAOs,
that are unable to be shut down by a single central entity but can still have rules and regulations via voting systems.

### User ownership
Remember that at its core a blockchain is an immutable ledger. One of the properties of this architecture is that it is a permanent and immutable
history of records of ownership of assets for users.

What this means is that if someone were to create a digital good, and another person were to buy the good, we can permanently record that
ownership on-chain via an NFT.This allows users to own their data rather than merely renting it from the centralized entities controlling the platform.

### Trustless architecture
Trustless architecture is a core feature of blockchain technology. When we have operations running in a closed data silo, there is no way to know what is
happening behind the scenes. We have to trust the entity running the platform.

This problem is partially solved by making our codebase open-sourced, but we still have to trust the centralized entities hosting the code. With blockchain,
smart contracts are code that is collectively hosted and validated by the entire network.

### Native digital payments
Since one of the core features of blockchains is money, building our app on top of blockchains allows us to hook into that native currency to run our platform.
This allows for not only a seamless payment integration but for every layer of that payment system to be censorship-resistant,
ensuring people that may not have access to traditional financial systems can still use it.

## Why Not Decentralize?

### User and developer experience
This is likely one of the biggest roadblocks the web3 industry needs to overcome. The web2 tech stack is much more mature than the web3 tech stack,
and we have many tools, both on the developer side and on the user side, that make it much easier to use web2 apps. Decentralization itself is very new compared to
web2, especially the contrast between data and authentication credentials living primarily on the organization’s servers vs being completely owned by the user.

It will require effort to transition the user experience.

### Performance
Blockchains are not designed to go fast. If they do, some other tradeoff has been made somewhere. Blockchains are designed to be secure, transparent, and permanent.
There are ways to get around this by using a layered approach similar to Stacks’ subnets or ZK Rollups, but if we absolutely need a lightning-fast app,
web3 isn’t quite there yet.

### Complexity
A web3 tech stack can get relatively complex and it can be hard to figure out which tool is responsible for which job.
If our goal is to get an app up and running as quickly as possible on very simple, proven architecture, decentralization might not be the best route.

Ultimately it comes down to weighing the pros and cons and seeing which option is best for our use case!

## Looking Behind the Door
With so much of the Internet happening behind closed doors and so many people being at the whim or large corporations or governments for critical things like finances,
the world wide web3 is rapidly becoming a promising way for people to build applications that maximize equality of opportunity and eliminate gatekeepers.

The builders who create and build now, when the tooling is less ideal, will be the ones that will reap the greatest reward as time goes on and adoption increases.
