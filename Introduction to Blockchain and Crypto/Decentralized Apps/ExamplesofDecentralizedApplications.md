# Examples of Decentralized Applications (Dapps)
In this article, we’ll go through a few examples of some dapps and what they are used for.

## Dapp Examples
Let’s go through a few examples of some Decentralizaed Apps (Dapps) and what they are used for. Three of the most popular use cases for dapps right now are:

- DeFi platforms
- Exchanges
- Asset marketplaces

Let’s look at a few of these. We’re taking a look at some dapps on DappRadar, which you can browse yourself to get an idea of what dapps exist in the ecosystem.

### Uniswap
Uniswap is an exchange that lives on the Ethereum chain. You can use Uniswap to exchange different tokens on Ethereum, as well as Polygon, Optimism, and Arbitrum,
which are layer 2 scaling solutions for Ethereum.

How is this decentralized? How does a decentralized exchange, like Uniswap, work?

They create liquidity pools for different tokens.
Users can add their tokens to a liquidity pool in exchange for a yield on that token.
Users swap their tokens by depositing in one pool and withdrawing from another.
What makes this decentralized is that this all happens via smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. There is no one entity that is controlling the pools,
the process of filling the pools, or the swapping of tokens. It is all happening via code that is collectively hosted by the nodes on the Ethereum network.

### Gamma
Gamma is an NFT marketplace on the Stacks blockchain. Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are essentially records of ownership for particular assets. Unlike fungible tokens,
NFTs, are unique. An NFT marketplace like Gamma allows users to buy and sell their NFTs in a trustless manner. Each transaction is happening on the public blockchain,
so it can’t be interfered with by whoever owns or runs Gamma.

This is a common theme you’ll begin to notice as you explore the world of dapps. They usually rely on some combination of centralized and decentralized architecture
with the core functionality living in smart contracts. Smart contracts form the foundation of most dapps and most functionality in a blockchain.

### Grape Protocol
Finally, we have Grape Protocol. This is a Solana project that allows people to more easily create and manage DAOs (decentralized autonomous organizations) as well
as create communities around them. It makes it easier for people to create voting mechanisms and access control to things like Discord so they can organize a community based on on-chain activity. DAOs are another popular web3 concept.

## What Do These Have in Common?
The common thread here is that the core functionality of each of these lives in smart contracts on a blockchain. The other components may or may not be
decentralized and may live in various places. It’s also important to note that we can build dapps without ever writing a smart contract ourselves!

For example, we could build a statically generated Next.js site that is hosted on Arweave and interacts with existing smart contracts on a blockchain via their API.
This would be considered a dapp even though we never wrote a smart contract ourselves.
