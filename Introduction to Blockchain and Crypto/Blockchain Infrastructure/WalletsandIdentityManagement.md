# Wallets and Identity Management
In the web2 world, we authenticate with usernames and passwords. In the decentralized web3, world we authenticate using cryptography and public/private key pairs.
The user-facing mechanism we use to do that is called a wallet. A wallet is a piece of software that allows us to create an address on a blockchain and then
authenticate using our private key to access it.

This address is how we interact with web3 dapps. This address can be thought of as a user account, except:

- Itâ€™s shared across all dapps that are on the same protocol.
- The data belongs to the wallet owner, us, not the platform.
- 
Using this wallet is what allows users to interact with our dapp! They are authenticated and can send transactions to the chain itself.

Some options for this are:

- Hiro Web Wallet
- Metamask
- Phantom
