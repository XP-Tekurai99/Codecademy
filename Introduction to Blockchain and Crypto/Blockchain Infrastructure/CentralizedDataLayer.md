# Centralized Data Layer
The centralized data layer is a single company or entity that will host endpoints on which we can query blockchain data and send blockchain data.
Unfortunately, they add a level of centralization to our dapp that we may not want, but the developer experience is usually great,
and it’s perfect for getting up and running.

The following list of tools are similar, it’s just a matter of preference on which you want:

- Stacks API
- Quicknode
- Infura
- Ankr
