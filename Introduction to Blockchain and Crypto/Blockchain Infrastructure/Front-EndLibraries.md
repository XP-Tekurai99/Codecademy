# Front-End Libraries
For the most part, the front-end framework (Next, Vue, Remix, etc.) will stay the same, but we will utilize different front-end libraries to interact with our chain.
These front-end libraries allow us to hook into our front-end app using something like JavaScript, and they will utilize our wallet to broadcast transactions to
the chain on our usersâ€™ behalf. They also allow us to more efficiently query data from the chain depending on the library and API protocol we are using.

Some options for this are:

- Stacks.js
- Ethers.js
- Web3.js
