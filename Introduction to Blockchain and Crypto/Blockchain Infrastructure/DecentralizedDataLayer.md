# Decentralized Data Layer
Decentralized data layers provide a similar function to centralized data layers, but rather than a single entity managing requests for data,
these have methods of decentralizing this process. Decentralized data layers have multiple nodes that provide the blockchain data for developers to pull.
They also have a consensus mechanism in place to incentivize proper data and punish false data.

These are some options for interacting with the blockchain from a decentralized service:

- KYVE Network
- The Graph
- Pocket Network (POKT)

We can set up our code to call one of these APIs when we need certain data in our dapp.
