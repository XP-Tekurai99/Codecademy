# Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)
In this article, learn about Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs).

## What is a DAO?
Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) are essentially a series of smart contracts, but with a lot of thought put into how the group of people
participating make decisions. A DAO is designed to be an alternative to a traditional corporate or government structure, and, in a DAO, decisions are made 
as a community and votes are recorded on-chain for transparency, verifiability, and immutability.

DAOs are still in their early stages, and still utilize a lot of the same hierarchical structure as traditional corporate structures. Natural leaders usually
will always emerge within an organization, but the ethos of a DAO is that this process will happen organically with the approval of the community as a whole.

### Transparency
Regardless of how autonomous a DAO is, a major benefit is the transparency of decision-making that comes with creating a DAO. Rather than decisions being
made behind closed doors and then decisions being handed down to the rest of the organization, DAOs allow for decisions to be made out in the open, on-chain.
DAOs have a bottom-up or horizontal power structure where traditional structures are top-down.

This is an example of a situation where people often make the “this is a solved problem” argument. Yes, a company or other organization could choose to
operate under an open governance model if they wanted to, but DAOs enforce this process on-chain. Even if a company is open and transparent with one leader,
the next leader may scrap those processes. By building an organization as a DAO, you enforce those ideals in code from the very beginning.

## How DAOs are Structured
DAOs are a series of intentionally designed smart contracts with a UI that allows people to interact with them. In a DAO, smart contracts are used for:

- Enforcing voting processes
- Treasury management

These are two of the primary use cases of a DAO, but a DAO could be organized around all sorts of things! In general,
community members will create proposals for the project and then vote on them in order to drive the project forward.

Once a DAO is formed, and its code pushed to the blockchain, it usually requires a certain amount of votes in order to change anything. Often, DAOs utilize
governance tokens issued to members in order to determine who has the right to vote and what they can vote on.

One of the best ways to figure our how DAOs work is to spin up your own using DAOHaus. This will allow you to experiment with how to set up a DAO and choose the
different parameters for creating and voting on proposals.

Usually, a DAO will utilize some form of communication tool as well! Discord is the most commonly used right now. DAOs can even be combined with NFTs to track
membership.

## Benefits of DAOs
- Ownership and decision-making power is distributed among all members.
- Smart contracts allow for automating processes based on the results of voting on a proposal.
- Allow for groups of people with aligned incentives to self-organize around a common goal.

## Drawbacks of DAOs
- Because of the decentralized and autonomous nature of DAOs, they can often lack cohesive leadership and direction.
- DAOs are still new, and the tooling to manage them can be clunky and difficult to use.

## Use Cases and Examples of DAOs
Any organization of people centered around a common theme or goal could potentially benefit from a DAO structure. Some of the most common use cases include
agencies, causes, and collectives/communities.

### Developer DAO
This is a good example of a collective/community. Developer DAO is a group of developers all working in web3 and seeking to grow and collaborate together.
It requires holding an NFT to be enter the Discord. One in, we work with the community to make decisions about:

- Projects to take on
- Content to create
- Community initiatives

### MolochDAO
MolochDAO is more of a protocol-level project. It seeks to provide a template for other projects to build on and be an industry standard for how to model a DAO.
DAOHaus is a no-code tool that allows anyone to spin up their own DAO that follows the implementation standards of MolochDAO.

### RaidGuild
RaidGuild is a design and development agency operating as a DAO. It’s one of the larger DAOs in the ecosystem, and they have a high demand for their services.
This is a good example of something that could have been a traditional company but is operating as a DAO in order to ensure transparency and decentralization
in their operations.

Members must go through a series of tasks in order to join and then be nominated to become a member. From there, members are free to pick up work that interests
them while contributing to the improvement of the community.

### ConstitutionDAO
This is an interesting example of a group of people rallying around the same cause. ConstitutionDAO attempted to organize and raise enough funds to buy and
collectively own a copy of the Constitution of the United States. They ultimately did not win the auction, but it was an interesting experiment for a use of a DAO.

### CheddarDAO
Let’s think about how we might apply what we’ve learned about DAOs to a fictional dapp, Cheddar.

If we want our dapp to be decentralized, we need to make sure the community has the power to make decisions and control the future of the platform. With this in
mind, we might want to consider creating a CheddarDAO, which will consist of the creators selling their creations on the platform.

Looking at the examples given, consider how we might go about setting up a DAO structure to handle:

- Changes to the codebase
- Whether not each individual product should be an NFT
- Any other piece of functionality that may be up for debate among the community.

A well-designed DAO can lead to a truly decentralized platform and organization that has no need of a central authority making top-down decisions.
